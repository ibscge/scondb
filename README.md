# Universal conditional knockout approach to multiple species, from fish to human cells


This repository accompanies our study introducing SCON, a simplified, adaptable, and universal strategy for generating conditional loss-of-function alleles in model systems where traditional approaches are inefficient.


## Overview
Studying essential genes involved in early development is challenging due to their lethality and the need for precise, conditional inactivation. Our platform provides a scalable and efficient solution for conditional knockout (cKO) design in:

- **Zebrafish**
- **Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)**
- **Intestinal organoids**

We also present a web-based database supporting over 300 vertebrate species, enabling researchers to identify candidate sites for conditional knockouts based on species-specific genome annotations.
